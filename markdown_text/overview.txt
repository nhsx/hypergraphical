### Overview

This work is a continuation of the hypergraphs work carried out by Rafferty et al. 2021:

[Multimorbidity Hypergraphs GitHub](https://github.com/SwanseaUniversityMedical/multimorbidity_hypergraphs), 
[Original Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046421002458).

We wish to demonstrate how hypergraphs can be used to capture relationships between multiple diseases 
rather than relationships between pairs of diseases. For example, looking at multimorbidity 
patterns instead of just comorbidities, which standard graphs tend to do. More people are suffering 
from multiple chronic diseases at the same time, so it's important to think about how we can find 
patterns in the uptake of multimoribidities, to see if prevention techniques or treatments could 
be put in place sooner to improve the quality of life in patients.
