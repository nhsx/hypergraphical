### Hypergraphs

Hypergraphs $\mathcal{H}(v,e)$ can connect 2 or more nodes per edge.

Hypergraphs were defined by Berge 1976, Berge defined hypergraphs to be an extension of graphs which enable relationships between
 many nodes, rather than just pairwise relationships. 

Hypergraphs enable multimorbidity edge connections between diseases to be established rather than only co-morbidity. Where the nodes 
are the diseases and the hyperedges are the multimorbidity sets.

Both graphs and hypergraphs can be undirected or directed. The key difference when directionality is involved is that the hypergraph 
edges (hyperedges), become hyperarcs due to their directionality, and can have different numbers of inputs and outputs (heads and 
tails).

#### Undirected Hypergraphs

The edges connecting nodes in undirected hypergraphs are called hyperedges. These hyperedges can be visualised as 'elastic bands' or
 with line connections (shown below).
Similar to the example given for standard graphs, the nodes in undirected hypergraphs can be diseases and the hyperedges represent 
relationships between these diseases. For example, showing that a person with disease $x$ will likely have disease $y$. 

The hyperedges can also store additonal information about the connection, such as how common/prevalent the relationship is between 
nodes/diseases.
