### Purpose of This Applet

The model shown in this applet builds upon the work carried out in Rafferty et al., 2021.
This Streamlit applet can be used to learn about how the hypergraphs multimorbidity model works with fictitious patient data. 
It provides test cases to allow users to understand the model and apply the `hypergraphs_mm` package to their own data 
(the `hypergraph-mm` package is currently held within a private NHSX GitHub repository but will soon become available publically and as a PyPI package).
It aims to explain graphs and hypergraphs in a health setting. It can be used to demonstrate the complexity of different types of 
graphs (left sidebar 'Show Maximum Number of Edges').
This website gives a interactive walkthrough of how to calulcate hyperedge weights, hyperarc weights, undirected hypergraph centrality, 
transition matrices and PageRank. The user can navigate between the pages using the tabs `Undirected Hypergraph`, `Directed Hypergraph` 
and `Successors` at the top of each page.
It demonstrates a method to draw B-hypergraphs using the NetworkX package, where psuedonodes are used for hyperarc tails to 
transition to hyperarc heads.
