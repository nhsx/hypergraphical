:blue[Prototype:] _This is not an official NHS England product or service but instead is an interactive applet prototype containing ongoing work.
This prototype aims only to demonstrate work that may be of interest to others.
Opinions expressed in this applet are not representative of the views of NHS England
and any content here should __not__ be regarded as official output in any form.
For more information about NHS England please visit our official 
[website](https://www.england.nhs.uk/)._

This applet randomly generates a set of __fictious__ 'patients' and their pathways to 
demonstrate the use of how hypergraphs can be used to explore multimorbidity. The 
sidebar on the left of this page can be used to change the number of 'patients' to 
generate and the maximum number of diseases to include in their pathways.
In changing the number of patients and diseases, the outputs will change 
and this is purposeful to enable you to observe how population alterations result in different outcomes.
