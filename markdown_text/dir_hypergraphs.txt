#### Directed B-Hypergraphs

Directed hypergraphs expand on undirected hypergraphs, but have the advantage that they can represent directionality between 
relationships i.e. the sequence in which conditions occur in patients.

A directed hypergraph $\mathcal{H}_D(V, \mathcal{E})$ is a collection of nodes stored in $V = \{v_1, \dots, v_n\}$, and hyperarcs, 
$\mathcal{E} = \{e_1, \dots,e_m\}$. Each hyperarc $e_i = \langle T(e_i), H(e_i)\rangle$ where $T(e_i), H(e_i) \subseteq V$ represents
 a collection of nodes such that those $v_i \in T(e_i)$ are the tails of the hyperarc and those $v_j \in H(e_i)$ are the heads of 
 the hyperarc. 

There are various types of directed hypergraphs, B-hypergraphs, F-hypergraphs, and BF-hypergraphs to name a few.
B-hypergraphs are restricted to have only one head node for each hyperarc, but can have unlimited tail nodes. For example, someone 
might have disease $C$ and $A$ (tail nodes) and then gain disease $B$ (head node) (see visual below). In the opposite case, 
F-hypergraphs can have only one tail node but unlimited head nodes. BF-hypergraphs have no restriction on the number of tail or head
nodes.

We chose to use B-hypergraphs due to the computational complexity being high in the  BF-hypergraph variation and because the 
clinical way that conditions tend to aggregate can be well represented with B-hypergraphs. However, we do appreciate the 
limitation here that someone may gain two diseases simultaneously, which could be better represented using BF-hypergraphs, but we 
apply a workaround to this. This is out of the scope of this dashboard, but further information can be found in an upcoming
publication and code base.

Undirected, parent hyperedges give rise to children hyperarcs (directed hyperedges). Sibling hyperarcs are hyperarcs which have the
same parent hyperedge and thus have the same set of nodes as the hyperarc in question. An example of a hyperarc with its siblings
and parent hyperedge are shown in the image below. You can explore and visualise how directed hypergraphs are built from multiple 
fictitious patients in the `Directed Hypergraph` tab at the top of this page.
