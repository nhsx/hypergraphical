_What are graphs and hypergraphs and why do we want to use them?_
Using hypergraphs enables more complexities and relationships from the data to be included. 
_Why?_ Let's start by describing __undirected graphs__, __directed graphs__, __undirected hypergraphs__ and __directed 
hypergraphs__. 

Graphs are very good at structuring interactivity and networks, which makes them particularly useful in healthcare where healthcare 
data can be sparse.

A standard graph $\mathcal{G}(v,e)$ can connect only 2 objects/nodes ($v$) with one edge ($e$). Only pairwise connections can exist.

Graphs can be directed or undirected. Directed graphs give directionality to node interactions. For a temporal example lets imagine 
$node_1$ is diabetes which could happen prior to $node_2$ which is chronic kidney disease, directionality shows the temporal order 
or sequence of events.
Alternatively, in an undirected graph edges connecting two nodes/diseases simply imply there is a relationship between the two.
Here we should emphasize that standard graphs only enable __pairwise__ relationships to be represented.


Graphs have the benefit of allowing extra information to be stored in the nodes or edges, these can be weights or attributes. For 
example, you may wish to store more details about a condition within a node or the elapsed time between disease contraction within 
an edge.
