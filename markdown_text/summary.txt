This applet randomly generates a set of fictious 'patients' and their disease
pathways to demonstrate the use of hypergraphs in understanding multimorbidity. The
sidebar on the left of this page can be used to change the number of 'patients' to
generate and the maximum number of diseases to include in their pathways.
In changing the number of patients and diseases, the outputs will change
and this is purposeful to enable you to observe how population alterations result in different outcomes.
